# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

The project was pretty self-explanatory with documentation I found online. The only thing that took me a long time to figure out was adding the functionality to save an event on the page. I never completed the last part of the functionality for the code quiz because I jsut wanted to submit it. So, that part was new to me. 

# Overall 
I think that I just need to figure out where to start. I find myself stuck in the beginning of assignments because it seems so overwhelming to me. That was the case with this assignment too, but then I looked up documentation and it seemed a lot simpler to me. But if I wasn't able to use documentation I would be completely lost still.
